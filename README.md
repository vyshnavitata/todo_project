PROJECT REPORT
Title

Todo Website Using Django

1. Introduction

Task management plays an important role in improving productivity and time management in daily life. With the increasing use of web applications, online task management systems have become essential tools for organizing personal and professional activities. A Todo Website provides a digital solution for users to manage their tasks efficiently.

This project focuses on the development of a Todo Website using the Django web framework. The application allows users to register, log in, and manage their tasks through a secure and user-friendly interface. Each user can create, view, update, and delete their own tasks. The project demonstrates the implementation of full-stack web development concepts using Python and Django.

2. Objective of the Project

The main objectives of this project are:

To develop a secure web-based task management system

To implement user authentication and authorization

To allow users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks

To understand Django’s Model–View–Template (MVT) architecture

To gain hands-on experience in backend and frontend web development

3. Project Abstract

The Todo Website is a web-based application developed using the Django framework that helps users manage their daily tasks efficiently. The primary goal of this project is to provide a simple, secure, and interactive platform where users can organize their tasks effectively. The system includes user authentication features that ensure data privacy by allowing users to access only their own tasks.

The application is developed using Django’s Model–View–Template (MVT) architecture, where models define the database structure, views handle the application logic, and templates manage the user interface. Python and Django ORM are used for backend development, while HTML, CSS, and Django Template Language (DTL) are used for frontend design. SQLite is used as the database for data storage.

This project demonstrates the implementation of core web development concepts such as authentication, database management, CRUD operations, and secure session handling. The Todo Website serves as a foundation for developing more advanced task management applications in the future.

4. System Requirements
Hardware Requirements

Processor: Intel i3 or above

RAM: Minimum 4 GB

Hard Disk: 20 GB free space

Software Requirements

Operating System: Windows / Linux / macOS

Programming Language: Python 3.x

Framework: Django

Database: SQLite

Code Editor: VS Code

Browser: Google Chrome / Edge

5. Technology Used

Python – Backend programming language

Django – Web framework for backend development

SQLite – Database for storing user and task data

HTML & CSS – Frontend structure and styling

Django Template Language (DTL) – Dynamic content rendering

6. System Architecture

The Todo Website follows Django’s Model–View–Template (MVT) architecture:

Model: Defines the database schema for users and tasks

View: Handles business logic and processes user requests

Template: Displays data to users using HTML and DTL

This architecture ensures separation of concerns, making the application modular, maintainable, and scalable.

7. Module Description
7.1 User Authentication Module

User Registration

User Login

User Logout

Session Management

7.2 Task Management Module

Add new tasks

View task list

Update existing tasks

Delete tasks

Each task is linked to a specific user to ensure data security.

8. Implementation Details

Django ORM is used for database operations

Forms are used for input validation

URL routing connects views with templates

Login-required decorators restrict unauthorized access

CSRF protection ensures secure form submission

9. Testing

The application was tested using manual testing methods:

Multiple user account creation

CRUD operation testing

Authentication and authorization checks

Form validation testing

All identified errors were resolved during testing.

10. Result

The Todo Website was successfully developed and tested. Users can securely manage their tasks using a simple and intuitive interface. The application performs all intended functions efficiently and meets the project objectives.

11. Conclusion

The Todo Website project successfully achieves its goal of providing a secure and efficient task management system using Django. The application ensures data privacy through user authentication and authorization. By following Django’s MVT architecture, the project maintains a clean and organized code structure.

This project provided practical exposure to full-stack web development, database management, authentication systems, and secure application design. The Todo Website serves as a strong foundation for building more advanced web applications.

12. Future Enhancements

The functionality of the Todo Website can be enhanced further by implementing the following features:

Task deadlines and reminder notifications

Task priority levels

Search and filter functionality

Task categorization and tagging

Improved UI using modern frontend frameworks

Cloud deployment for scalability

Analytics and task progress reports
